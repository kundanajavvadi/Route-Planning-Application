This Route Planning Application is a Java-based solution that uses a graph data structure to represent a network of stations and routes. Each station is a node, and the routes between stations are weighted edges, where the weights represent the travel time, distance, or cost. The application calculates the shortest path between any two stations using Dijkstra's Algorithm, optimized with a Min-Heap for efficient priority queue operations.
